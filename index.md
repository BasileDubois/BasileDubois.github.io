**<u>This page is a work in progress and will be ready by September 1st 2024. Please have another look then!</u>**

Hello there, welcome to my personal page! I am a PhD Candidate from [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu){:target="_blank"}. In September, I am be on the 2024-2025 Finance and Economics Job Market. I'm looking forward to meeting you! 

I exploit strucural models and demand systems to explore empirical economic questions in financial intermediation and corporate governance.  

My [Job Market Paper]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/5-researchstatement/){:target="blank} explores the interaction of Basel III regulation with large scale asset purchases, also known as Quantitative Easing, and its resulting consequences. 

You can check out my [research]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/){:target="blank} or have a look at my [research statement]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/5-ResearchStatement/) for further information. 

Do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:basile.dubois@tse-fr.eu) if you have any question, comment or thought about my research. Discussing ideas is 90% of the fun of Academia!

In the spirit of scientific transparency, I try to make the code for my projects available whenever possible. You will find the code for a given project at the end of its related blog post in the [research]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/) section.
