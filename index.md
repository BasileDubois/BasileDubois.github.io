Hello there, welcome to my personal page! I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at [McGill Desautels Faculty of Management](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/research/specializations/finance).  I will defend my PhD at [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu){:target="_blank"} in October 2025.

I exploit **structural models and demand systems** to explore empirical economic questions in **financial intermediation** and **corporate governance**. My recent research explores the impact of large scale asset purchases, also known as Quantitative Easing, and its [interaction with bank regulation]({{site.url}}/downloads/JMP.pdf). 

You can check out my [research]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/){:target="blank} or have a look at my [research statement]({{site.baseurl}}/ResearchStatement/) for further information. You will find the code for a given project at the end of its related blog post in the [research]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/) section. 

Do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:basile.dubois@mcgill.ca) if you have any question, comment or thought about my research. Discussing ideas is 90% of the fun of Academia!
