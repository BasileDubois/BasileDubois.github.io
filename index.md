Hello there, welcome to my personal page! I am a PhD Candidate from [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu){:target="_blank"}. I will be on the 2024-2025 Finance and Economics Job Market. I'm looking froward to meeting you!

I am a financial economist with broad research interests spanning Banking, Monetary policy, Securities markets, Regulation and Corporate Governance. My [Job Market Paper]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/5-ResearchStatement/){:target="blank} explore the interaction of Basel III regulation with large scale asset purchases, and the resulting consequences. I have a strong Toulouse bias and tend to use strucural models and demand systems to explore empirical economic questions. You can check out my [research]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/){:target="blank} or have a look at my [research statement]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/5-ResearchStatement/){:target="blank}  for more information. 

Do not hesitate to [contact me](basile.dubois@tse-fr.eu){:target="blank} if you have any question, comment or thoughts about my research. Discussing ideas is 90% of the fun of Academia!
