#  <ins>Research Statement</ins>

I am a Financial Economist with research interests spanning IO-Finance, Banking, Monetary policy, Securities markets, Regulation and Corporate Governance. Methodologically, I like to answer policy-related questions using structural models and rich micro data. My approach is to take advantage of my institutional knowledge and appetence for reading the financial press to identify gaps between the predictions from economic theory, observed outcomes and practitioners' beliefs.

Current research 
------------ 

During my PhD, my principal area of interest went from corporate governance to the impact of unconventional monetary policy on financial intermediation and banking. I will discuss each in detail, starting with my JMP, then outline my research agenda for the next few years. 

#### Financial intermediation, banking and unconventional monetary policy

Following the Great Financial Crisis, central banks engaged in [unconventional monetary policy](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Bernanke_ASSA_lecture.pdf){:target="blank} to curtail the the economic impact of the crisis. While these policies were greatly successful in addressing [market turmoil](https://www.nber.org/papers/w17555){:target="blank}, their [broader](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378426621003009){:target="blank} [outcome](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22285){:target="blank} [is](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2305){:target="blank} [debatable](https://www.un.org/en/desa/unconventional-monetary-policy-reaching-its-limits){:target="blank}. In the context of this research, I have been [granted access](https://www.casd.eu/en/project/the-impact-of-unconventional-monetary-policy-on-credit-issuance-and-asset-prices-a-structural-model-of-demand-for-the-asset-and-liabilities-of-a-banks-balance-sheet/){:target="blank} to confidential Banque de France data on securities holdings, bank's balance sheets, as well as to the French credit registry.  

The core argument of my research in this area is that **unconventional monetary policy entails hidden costs and complex ripple effects that decision-makers should consider, which necessitates careful structural modeling for proper evaluation**. 

My [Job Market Paper]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2024/JMP){:target="blank}, written jointly with [Paul Rintamaki](https://sites.google.com/view/paulrintamaki){:target="blank}, a PhD student at Aalto University, explores the interaction between [Basel III regulation](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm){:target="blank} and [excess liquidity](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb-and-you/explainers/tell-me-more/html/excess_liquidity.en.html){:target="blank} resulting from [Large Scale Asset Purchases](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/app/html/index.en.html){:target="blank}. Specifically, large-scale asset purchases massively expanded the quantity of reserves sitting on the banks’ balance sheets. In the Eurozone, there is no mechanism to drain excess reserves from the banking system, which means that reserves take up space on the balance sheet of banks. Since Basel III regulations limit balance sheet space, this induces crowding-out: banks sell securities and issue fewer loans, which counteracts the intended expansionary effects of Quantitative Easing.

Our paper innovates in three main areas. First, our model of bank competition allows us to precisely quantify the trade-offs resulting from excess reserves on the banking system in terms of interest rates and induced demand. This enables us to estimate counterfactuals and produce optimal policy recommendations for different Central Bank objectives.  Second, we compute the shadow cost of Basel III regulation on banks' marginal cost. We achieve this by creating a structured cost function that is the empirical generalization of a theoretical constrained optimization problem, inspired by the seminal work of [Lé, Fraisse and Thesmar (2020)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3222){:target="blank}. Third, we model the entire balance sheets of banks by combining large regulatory datasets on balance sheets, securities holdings, the French credit registry, and the BankFocus database. This allows us to seamlessly compute the trade-offs between different asset types as banks optimize their investment portfolios. This is crucial because European banks are [not](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-banks-regulations/eu-scraps-itsanswer-to-u-s-volcker-rule-for-banks-idUSKBN1CT285/){:target="blank} subject to the [Volcker Rule](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/volcker-rule.htm){:target="blank}, meaning their lending activities are not segregated from market activities.

While my JMP explores the banks' balance sheet side of Asset Purchases, I am also currently working on [quantifying the impact of Asset Purchases on the European bond market]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2024/BondsQE){:target="blank}. Building on Gabaix and Koijen's [inelastic market hypothesis](https://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2022-10/SSRN-id3686935.pdf){:target="blank}, I examine how the reduction in aggregate bond supply affected the price level and the role of inelastic demand in amplifying that process. Importantly, as investors can rebalance -- adjust -- their portfolios, the impact of asset purchases spreads to other markets. I borrow the methodology from [Koijen and Yogo (2019)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/701683?mobileUi=0&){:target="blank} to characterize the demand function of bond market investors, and outline how sophisticated investors can exploit limits to arbitrage to pre-empt the Central Banks:  these investors front-load their investments in bonds targeted by purchase programs, then offload them once the price increases to buy bonds that were not targeted by purchases. This suggests that the success of asset purchases hinges on inelastic demand and limited substitution between different asset markets. However, these same characteristics enable arbitrageurs to extract significant surplus from Central Banks' policies and make transmission of asset purchases to the broader economy difficult to target. Given the relatively low substitution between market segments, I argue that Central Banks should target asset purchases more narrowly in both time scale and scope.

#### Corporate Governance

Corporate governance has been the subject to significant regulatory oversight since the late 1990s, with the 2002 [Sarbanes-Oxley Act](https://sarbanes-oxley-act.com){:target="blank} serving as a keystone. My research explores two main areas of modern corporate governance regulation: board appointments, and executive compensation. I will detail them in turn. 


[Regulation](https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2022/02/the-informed-board/what-exactly-is-an-independent-director){:target="blank}  [has](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/73020/000119312506162571/dex991.htm){:target="blank} [been](https://www.iod.com/resources/governance/governance-explainer-director-independence/){:target="blank} put in place to ensure that directors are [independent](https://fortune.com/2023/10/16/modern-board-directors-independence/){:target="blank} at nomination, the implicit assumption being that management will try to stack the board with friendly faces. 
In my project [Networks in the Board of Directors]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2024/BoardApointments){:target="blank}, I challenge the prevailing assumption that pre-existing relationships favor candidates in the board recruitment process. Candidates with prior associations to current board members are actually less likely to be appointed, though they are more likely to be considered. Indeed, the traits that increase a candidate's visibility to recruiters--such as industry experience--are often correlated with connections to the board. This correlation introduces significant bias and has led to misleading conclusions in past research.


Another key element of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and similar regulations around the world is pay transparency. These policies are based on the assumption that disclosing executive compensation would allow shareholders to exert control and curb  the explosion of executive pay. In [What you see is what you get paid]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2024/CEOPayTransparency){:target="blank},  I argue that pay transparency regulations may have inadvertently increased it by shifting the bargaining power [in favor of executives](https://action.deloitte.com/insight/3065/what-do-pay-transparency-trends-mean-for-ceo-compensation){:target="blank}. This finding calls into question the effectiveness of transparency as a tool for controlling executive pay. This is not entirely surprising, given that pay transparency has been used in [other contexts](https://www.conference-board.org/publications/countdown-to-eu-new-law-on-pay-transparency-multinationals-must-move-faster){:target="blank} to [increase the bargaining power of salaried workers](https://www.wtwco.com/en-ke/insights/2024/02/the-momentum-and-future-of-pay-transparency-in-the-us){:target="blank}.


Research Agenda
-------

#### Financial intermediation

I want to build on my current projects to further the understanding of unconventional monetary policy. Specifically, there is currently a poor understanding of the aggregate [benefits and costs of asset purchases](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2024/html/ecb.sp240528~a4f151497d.en.html){:target="blank} for the taxpayers, the financial stability impact of [unwinding the purchases](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2023/741479/IPOL_IDA(2023)741479_EN.pdf){:target="blank}, as well as the transmission mechanism to the [housing market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2024/03/13/collateral-damage-from-fed-policy-part-2-a-broken-housing-market/){:target="blank} and how [carry trades](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2110701719300095){:target="blank} altered the outcome of the policy. Lastly, I want to further explore the consequences of the new monetary framework, where the quantity of excess reserves is now decorrelated from the base interest rate. This opens up many policy-relevant questions, such as whether or not we ought to [allow non-banks to acces the Central bank's balance sheet](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/01/how-the-feds-overnight-reverse-repo-facility-works/){:target="blank}, or [what is the optimal quantity of excess reserves](https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/2015/ec-201502-excess-reserves-oceans-of-cash){:target="blank}. More generally, this should make us think differently about [the money multiplier](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2023/07/the-monetary-multiplier-and-bank-reserves/){:target="blank}, taking stock of the fact that central banks relinquished a great amount of control over the [money supply](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/84209/1/Goodhart_Determination%20money%20supply_2017.pdf){:target="blank}, with according potential consequences for financial stability. As discussed above, I secured [data access](https://www.casd.eu/en/project/the-impact-of-unconventional-monetary-policy-on-credit-issuance-and-asset-prices-a-structural-model-of-demand-for-the-asset-and-liabilities-of-a-banks-balance-sheet/){:target="blank} that allows me to address these questions with high-quality datasets.




#### Corporate Governance

Both of my corporate governance papers suggest that current regulation is inefficient at achieving its stated policy objectives. Pay transparency can reinforce the bargaining power of CEOs and pushes compensation upwards, while director independence regulation adresses an issue that is overstated.   [The problem with board independence](https://fortune.com/2023/10/16/modern-board-directors-independence){:target="blank} is actually likely to start after appointment, as management can cosy up to directors once they are appointed. Further, there is a significant [element](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/116/3/901/1899775){:target="blank} of [luck](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/33/7/3174/5513177){:target="blank} in executive pay. In the future, I want to explore the efficacy of alternative corporate governance policies, such as binding shareholder votes, director [term limits](https://www.hanselladvisory.com/publication/term-limits-for-directors/){:target="blank}, [director professionalisation](https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/article/position-paper/director-professionalism-review-of-director-training-programs-in-apac.pdf){:target="blank} -- fostering influential multi-firm directors, or different pay designs, including [longer](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/06/22/the-fascinating-part-of-the-changes-to-tim-cooks-restricted-apple-stock/){:target="blank} (5/10+ years) share vesting periods for executives, associated with shorter [cliffs](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation/sections/vesting-and-cliffs){:target="blank} and shorter exercise periods to avoid [timing](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0365){:target="blank} issues.
