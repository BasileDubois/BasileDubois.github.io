Teaching Philosophy 
------------ 


I genuinely like to interact with students. At the heart of my teaching philosophy is student engagement and the creation of an inclusive, collaborative learning environment. I see the classroom as a space for interaction, where my role is not only to impart knowledge but to mentor students in their intellectual and personal growth. Whether teaching graduate students, MBA students or undergraduates, my goal is to foster an atmosphere where every student, regardless of background, feels empowered to contribute, collaborate, and learn.

Following the general principles of a [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom), I aim to provide students with the resources they need to study independently while using class time to clarify concepts and solve problems together. For instance, if I have to teach a typical 3-hour lecture, I'll split it into three 45-minute blocks with breaks in between. This pacing helps students absorb material more effectively and allows for informal interactions during breaks. Additionally, I distribute written class notes at least a week in advance, ensuring students are prepared. In return, I ask that students come to tutorials having worked on the problem sets to ensure productive discussions. I’ve seen this approach work particularly well in diverse classrooms, such as when I taught Introduction to Corporate Finance at Toulouse School of Management.

In line with my commitment to inclusion, I work to ensure that my teaching methods are flexible enough to accommodate students from various backgrounds. I recognize that **students may face different challenges—whether personal, academic, or systemic—**and I aim to create a classroom culture where everyone feels supported. Therefore,[project-based learning](https://www.bu.edu/ctl/ctl_resource/project-based-learning-teaching-guide/#:~:text=in%20your%20classes.-,Introduction,problems%2C%20commonly%20in%20small%20teams), is central to my teaching strategy. Group projects not only foster collaboration but also teach valuable professional skills such as setting schedules, managing deadlines, and coordinating with peers. Group work benefits all students. Those who grasp the material more quickly reinforce their understanding by explaining concepts to their peers, while others gain new insights and motivation through collaborative learning. For example, in my tutorials for Corporate Finance at Toulouse School of Economics, students worked in groups to solve real-world financial problems. The tutorials became spaces for active dialogue where I guided students through problem-solving without giving direct answers. This approach empowered students to discover solutions on their own, building both their confidence and problem-solving skills. In my experience, students appreciate the opportunity to work on practical challenges that mirror real-world situations.

Whether I am teaching **corporate finance**, **data science**, or **empirical methods**, I focus on applying academic concepts to real-world scenarios, preparing students for the challenges they will face in their careers. This is particularly true in finance, where students need to understand not only theoretical models but also the strategic decision-making processes that drive businesses.

Teaching Experience 
------------ 

I have taught courses across various levels:

- Lecturer and course coordinator for master-level Introduction to Corporate Finance at Toulouse School of Management (Fall 2020).
- Tutorials for Introductory Corporate Finance and Microeconomics (Producer Theory) to undergraduate students at Toulouse School of Economics (Spring 2021 to Spring 2022).

These experiences have shaped my growth as a teacher and influenced my current teaching philosophy. During the fall of 2020, I was fully responsible for every aspect of the Introduction to Corporate Finance course at Toulouse School of Management. As the sole course coordinator, lecturer, and tutorial instructor, I designed and delivered all course content, and provided guidance to students throughout the semester. This course was particularly transformative, as the students came from extremely diverse academic backgrounds—ranging from vocational schools to elite French preparatory programs. My goal was to ensure that all students remained engaged with the material while allowing everyone to learn at their own pace.

Teaching during the pandemic added an extra layer of complexity, as we had to switch to online-teaching halfway through the term. Students presented their group projects online, which allowed them to continue collaborating and applying the concepts they had learned. For the final exam, I decided to conduct one-on-one online interviews to better assess each student’s understanding. As these interviews unfolded, I was thrilled to see that the vast majority of students had not only firmly grasped the core concepts but had also deeply engaged with the content. Witnessing how my approach succeeded in reaching such a diverse array of students was one of the most rewarding moments of my teaching career.

Since 2022, I have been focusing on my research and look forward to returning to teaching.




Inclusive and supportive learning environments
------------

Students come from various cultural, socio-economic, and educational backgrounds, and it is crucial to recognize these differences and adapt accordingly. As teachers, we have a unique role in supporting students from diverse backgrounds and helping them succeed, not just academically but also in life.  My strategy to address these issues in and out of the classroom and empower focuses on **engagement, flexibility, and empowerment**.

- Engagement: I strive to build connections with my students at a personal level. I make time to speak individually with as many students as possible throughout the term, understanding their goals, struggles, and perspectives. In addition to weekly office hours, I maintain open lines of communication to discuss academic matters or broader mentoring topics. Understanding my students’ diverse perspectives helps me support them more effectively, whether they are struggling academically or facing personal challenges. 

- Flexibility: Life doesn’t always follow a schedule, and I believe in offering flexibility to students who may face unexpected challenges. While I emphasize the importance of deadlines and professional standards, I also provide options for students who need additional time or resources. My grading system rewards improvement and growth, offering students the opportunity to recover from setbacks. I believe that a fair assessment system not only upholds academic standards but also provides students with the chance to learn from their mistakes and develop resilience. 

- Empower: I believe empowerment also comes through consistent, personalized feedback. Even in larger classes, I make the effort to provide detailed guidance through group projects, giving students a path to improve.  In every class, I include projects that allow students to make decisions about their work, which helps them connect the course material to their personal interests and experiences. This gives them ownership over their learning, which increases their engagement and encourages critical thinking.  In addition to providing personalized feedback, I actively seek feedback from students, both formal and informal, so that they feel heard and valued in shaping the course. This open dialogue allows me to respond to their needs and tailor my support accordingly. I’m always willing to sincerely recommend high-achieving students, but I also take pride in helping struggling students find their footing and develop their skills. Mentorship plays a critical role—I guide students toward the resources they need to overcome challenges and follow up to ensure they’re making progress. The long-term relationships I’ve built with former students, many of whom I’ve mentored through pivotal early career decisions, are a testament to this commitment. Trust is central to empowerment. When I support students, whether through recommendations or professional introductions, I invest my own reputation. This motivates them to take responsibility and rise to the challenge. By trusting them with real opportunities, I help them build the confidence and drive to succeed beyond the classroom.


Teaching portfolio
------------ 

Given my research, my teaching experience, and the topics I interact with daily, I feel comfortable teaching classes revolving around three main areas:

### Finance:

I have thoroughly enjoyed [teaching **corporate finance** to both undergraduate and master’s students]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/COURSELINK), and would be excited to teach it again, especially in MBA programs that prioritize practical, real-world applications of financial theory. I see finance as fascinating field to teach that involve deep economics: it sees the interplay of contract theory, economic history, monetary economics, competition and markets, insurance and risk, and behavioral economics. Depending on the department’s focus, I can tailor the course to emphasize how finance relates to these broader topics. 

I am also well-equipped to teach **Banking**, **Corporate Governance**, and **Monetary Economics**, particularly in advanced settings. My research in these areas provides a strong foundation for delivering up-to-date, nuanced perspectives to students.

### Data science and empirical methods: 

My extensive experience of R, as well as my understanding of numerous programming languages such as Python, Julia, Stata, make me well-positioned to teach a  **data science through programming** class. I code daily, use large datasets, and have integrated new tools such as AI assistants in my workflow. As such, I have ironed the kinks of what data science entails in the modern age and can offer insights into current trends.  For MBA students,  I can tailor the course to emphasize the strategic use of data analytics, focusing on interpreting data for business decision-making and using data visualization tools to communicate insights effectively.

I can also teach courses on **Empirical Methods** with a focus on structural economic approaches. These tools are increasingly relevant in finance and offer powerful ways to estimate supply and demand systems. I can teach these advanced methods to graduate students, offering them cutting-edge skills that are rapidly becoming indispensable in both academia and industry.


### General introductory economics: 

As I stated above, my research takes cues from industrial organization. As such, I can teach introductory IO at the undergrad level, along with courses revolving around competition and markets.  I can also teach **Introductory Econometrics**, **Microeconomics**, and **Monetary Economics** at the undergraduate level. I particularly enjoy teaching introductory courses because they challenge me to distill complex concepts into simple, understandable ideas. This process of simplifying without losing rigor is at the core of why I love teaching.
