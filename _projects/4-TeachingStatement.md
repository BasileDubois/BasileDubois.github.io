Teaching Philosophy 
------------ 

I prioritize student engagement and aim to create an inclusive, collaborative learning environment. The classroom is a space for interaction, where my role extends beyond imparting knowledge to mentoring students in their intellectual and personal growth. Recognizing that **students may face different challenges--whether personal, academic, or systemic--**I employ flexible teaching methods to accommodate diverse backgrounds, specifically through a flipped classroom approach and project-based learning.

Following the general principles of a [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom), I provide the resources for students to study independently at their own pace and dedicate class time to clarifying concepts and collaborative problem-solving. I’ve seen this approach work particularly well when facing a diverse classroom, such as when I taught Introduction to Corporate Finance at Toulouse School of Management.

[Project-based learning](https://www.bu.edu/ctl/ctl_resource/project-based-learning-teaching-guide/#:~:text=in%20your%20classes.-,Introduction,problems%2C%20commonly%20in%20small%20teams) is central to my teaching strategy.  Group projects help students develop essential skills such as scheduling, deadline management, and teamwork. In my Corporate Finance tutorials at Toulouse School of Economics, students tackled real-world financial problems. During interactive sessions, I guided students without providing direct answers. This method built their confidence and enhanced their problem-solving skills.

I focus on applying academic concepts to real-world scenarios as it prepares students for the challenges they will face in their careers. This is particularly true in finance, where students need to understand not only theoretical models but also the strategic decision-making processes that drive businesses.

Teaching Experience 
------------ 

I have taught courses across various levels:

- Lecturer and course coordinator for master-level Introduction to Corporate Finance at Toulouse School of Management (Fall 2020).
- Tutorials for Introductory Corporate Finance and Microeconomics (Producer Theory) to undergraduate students at Toulouse School of Economics (Spring 2021 to Spring 2022).

During the fall of 2020, I was the sole course coordinator, lecturer, and tutorial instructor for the Introduction to Corporate Finance course at Toulouse School of Management. I designed and delivered all course content, and provided guidance to students throughout the semester. Students came from extremely diverse academic backgrounds—ranging from vocational schools to elite French preparatory programs.  

Midway through the term, the pandemic necessitated an abrupt shift to online teaching. I adapted by facilitating online group project presentations, which allowed students to continue collaborating and applying the concepts they had learned. I conducted the final exam as one-on-one online interviews to assess each student’s understanding of the material. The vast majority of students demonstrated a strong grasp of core concepts and deep engagement with the content, which vindicated the effectiveness of my teaching methods in a challenging environment. 

Since 2022, I have been focusing on my research and look forward to returning to teaching.


Inclusive and Supportive Learning Environments
------------

Students come from various cultural, socio-economic, and educational backgrounds. It is crucial to recognize these differences and adapt accordingly. My strategy focuses on:

- Engagement:  I make time to speak individually with as many students as possible throughout the term to understand their goals, struggles, and perspectives. 

- Flexibility: I offer flexibility to students who may face unexpected issues. My grading system rewards improvement and growth, offering students the opportunity to recover from setbacks. I believe that a fair assessment system not only upholds academic standards but also provides students with the chance to learn from their mistakes and develop resilience. 

- Support: I provide consistent, personalized feedback. In larger classes, I make the effort to provide detailed guidance through group projects, giving students a path to improve. I mentor both high-achieving and struggling students, guiding them toward resources and monitoring their progress.
 
Conclusion
-------------

In sum, my teaching philosophy centers on engaging students and accommodating diversity in the classroom through flexible methods like flipped classrooms and project-based learning.  My experiences have demonstrated that these approaches are effective, both in traditional and online settings. 

Teaching Portfolio
------------ 

Given my research, my teaching experience, and the topics I interact with daily, I am prepared to teach classes in three main areas:

### Finance:


My expertise allows me to teach courses in the  **corporate finance**, **Banking**, **Corporate Governance**, and **Monetary Economics**. My research provides a strong foundation for delivering up-to-date, nuanced perspectives to students.

I see finance as fascinating field to teach that involve deep economics. Depending on the department, I can tailor courses to emphasize the interplay between finance and broader economic topics. My teaching approach is also well-suited for MBA programs that prioritize practical, real-world applications of financial theory. 


### Data science and empirical methods: 

With extensive experience in R, Python, Julia, and Stata, I can teach **data science through programming**. I code daily, use large datasets, and have integrated new tools such as AI assistants in my workflow. As such, I have ironed the kinks of what data science entails in the modern age and can offer insights into current trends.

I can also teach  **Empirical Methods** with a focus on structural approaches borrowed from industrial organization, providing graduate students with advanced skills that are valuable in both academia and industry.


### General introductory economics: 

I can teach **Introductory Industrial Organization**, **Introductory Econometrics**, **Microeconomics**, and **Monetary Economics** at the undergraduate level. I enjoy teaching introductory courses because they challenge me to distill complex concepts into simple, understandable ideas.
