I am a {{YearsSince}} years old, staunchly Parisian 🥖 financial economist. I am currently pursuing a PhD at [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu){:target="_blank"} 🎓.  \
I was invited as a visiting officer of research at [Columbia University Business School](https://business.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} during the fall semester of 2022. \
Before that, I obtained a dual-degree undergrad in  Economics and Mathematics at [Université Panthéon-Assas](https://assas-universite.fr/fr){:target="blank} and [Sorbonne Université](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr){:target="blank}, and a joint Economics and Applied Mathematics masters from [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/){:target="blank} and the [Erasmus Mundus quantitative economics program](https://master-economics-qem.eu){:target="blank} 📚. 

Research philosophy 🔍
------------

I like to take an empirical look at policy questions by combining insights from economic theory and the opinion of practitioners. Bridging the gap between practitioners' beliefs and economic theory predictions often leads to interesting, policy-relevant research. 

Throughout my PhD in Toulouse, I have developed an expertise building and working with large datasets, as well as taking the empirical industrial organization methodology to Financial Economics. Many questions in  Finance revolve around supply and demand, and empirical IO tools are uniquely suited to address that. 


Global outlook 🌍
---------

My upbringing in multicultural Paris, as well as my experiences working for the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en.html){:target="blank} and living in Barcelona 🇪🇸, Utrecht 🇳🇱, and NYC 🗽 during the course of my studies gave me a strong belief in the power of diversity, as well as the importance european and international cooperation 🫱🏿‍🫲🏻. I value working with and learning from people of diverse cultures. From my standpoint, interacting with different cultural perspectives helps avoid narrow-mindedness and fosters inclusivity.  

The [climate emergency](https://www.unep.org/facts-about-climate-emergency){:target="blank} is an issue I take seriously 🌿🔥. Therefore, I have been working as a consultant for the OECD on research into financing the climate transition. You can check it out [here](){:target="blank}. Ensuring that the climate transition is properly financed while minimising the adverse effects of policy intervention is surprisingly difficult. Economics, despite being quantitatively grounded, remains a political science and cannot be separated from politics. As researchers,  we have a unique opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the ongoing debates 🗳️. 

Hobbies and lifestyle 🏃‍♂️
--------

My 7 years stint in Toulouse left me with a fondness for the mountains, and a burning passion for rugby 🏉. On top 14 match days, you can definitely find me cheering on the [Stade Toulousain](https://www.stadetoulousain.fr/){:target="blank}!
I also like to spend my energy burning calories. Living with [spondyloarthritis](https://rheumatology.org/patients/spondyloarthritis){:target="blank} since I was 11--a degenerative inflammatory disease affecting the spine and joints--has taught me resilience and the importance of maintaining a balanced lifestyle: I enjoy running, cycling, and spending a few weeks each year hiking in the mountains. 🏔️

I am an avid reader with a strong appetite for non-fiction and pop academic literature, particularly in the fields of economics, history, geopolitics, and diplomacy. Please do ask me about my current reads—I'm always happy to discuss and exchange recommendations! 🤓 \
And finally, 🚨 NERD ALERT 🚨: I love playing board games, painting miniatures 🎨, and even indulging in video games once in a while 🎮.
