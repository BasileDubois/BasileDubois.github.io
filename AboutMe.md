I am a {{YearsSince}} years old, **staunchly Parisian** financial economist. I am currently pursuing a PhD at [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu){:target="_blank"}. 🎓 \
I was invited as a visiting officer of research at [Columbia University Business School](https://business.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} during the fall semester of 2022. \
Before that, I obtained a dual-degree undergrad in  Economics and Mathematics at [Université Panthéon-Assas](https://assas-universite.fr/fr){:target="blank} and [Sorbonne Université](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr){:target="blank}, and a joint Economics and Applied Mathematics masters from [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/){:target="blank} and the [Erasmus Mundus quantitative economics program](https://master-economics-qem.eu){:target="blank}. 📚

Research philosophy
------------

I like to take an empirical look at policy questions by combining insights from economic theory and the opinion of practitioners. Bridging the gap between practitioners' beliefs and economic theory predictions often leads to interesting, policy-relevant research. 

During the course of my PhD in Toulouse, I have developed an expertise building and working with large datasets, as well as taking the empirical industrial organization methodology to Financial Economics. A lot of questions in Economics ultimately boil down to supply and demand, and empirical IO tools are uniquely suited to address that. 


Global outlook
---------

My upbringing in multicultural Paris, as well as my experiences working for the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en.html){:target="blank} and living in Barcelona, Utrecht and NYC during the course of my studies gave me a strong belief in the power of diversity, as well as the importance european and international cooperation. I value working with and learning from people of diverse cultures. From my standpoint, interacting with different cultural perspectives helps avoid narrow-mindedness and fosters inclusivity.  🫱🏿‍🫲🏻

I also believe in the [climate emergency](https://www.unep.org/facts-about-climate-emergency){:target="blank}. As such, I have been working as a consultant for the OECD on research about the financing of the climate transition. You can check it out [here](){:target="blank}. Ensuring that the climate transition is properly financed while minimising the adverse effects of policy intervention is surprisingly difficult. Economics, despite being quantitatively grounded, remains a political science and cannot be separated from politics. It therefore is our duty as researchers to contribute to the ongoing debates. 

Hobbies and lifestyle
--------

My 7 years stint in Toulouse left me with a fondness for the mountains, and a burning passion for rugby 🏉. On top 14 match days, you can definitely find me watching the [Stade Toulousain](https://www.stadetoulousain.fr/){:target="blank} play!
I also like to spend my energy burning calories. Living with [spondyloarthritis](https://rheumatology.org/patients/spondyloarthritis){:target="blank}, a type of inflammatory arthritis affecting the spine and joints, since I was 11 has taught me resilience and the importance of maintaining a balanced lifestyle: I enjoy running, cycling, and spending a few weeks each year hiking in the mountains. 🏔️

I am an avid reader with a strong appetite for popular academic literature, particularly in the fields of economics, history, geopolitics, and diplomacy. Please do ask me about my current reads—I'm always happy to share! ! I also welcome your reading recommendations. 🤓 \
Finally, 🚨 NERD ALERT 🚨, I'm happy playing board games, and enjoy painting miniatures and playing video games once in a while.
