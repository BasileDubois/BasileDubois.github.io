## Selected Working Papers
- [Banking under Large Excess Reserves (JMP)]()
  - Co-authored with Paul Rintamaki (Aalto University).  Using a structural model of banking, we quantify the trade-offs imposed by excess reserves on banks' lending and risk-taking activities. We compute counterfactual estimates of alternative policies as well as the implications of quantitative tightening.

- [Inelastic Markets and the Transmission of Asset Purchases]()  
  - This paper investigates the transmission mechanisms of quantitative easing (QE) through institutional bondholders' portfolio adjustments. 
 

- [The Determinants of Director Selection: Relationships in the Director Market]()  
  - This paper studies the role of pre-existing relationships on board appointments. I use a consideration sets framework to show that candidates with prior associations to board members are less likely to be appointed, despite being more likely to be considered.
